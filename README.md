On going project


1. For simple dataset:
    * Created and saved shot dataframe for every competition available in the Statsbomb data --> dataset.sh
    * Create and saved train and test dataframe from the shot data we extracted from the Statsbomb data --> train_test.sh
    * Create 5 folds for train data because of the skewed nature of the data.
    * label encoding or one hot encoding
    * preparing the dataset --> distance in yards
    * Use Logistic Regression, Random Forest and xG Boost algorithm on the data.
    * Tesing the model on test set using visualization and table.
